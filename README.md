Library-API
The Library-API project, developed for the Operations Development discipline, aims to create an API simulating a library environment. This API facilitates the management of library resources, including books, authors, and reservations, while integrating various DevOps tools for streamlined deployment and automation.

Project Overview
The primary goal of the project is to showcase the integration of DevOps tools such as Docker images, Docker Containers, Jenkins, Portainer, and CI/CD pipelines. By utilizing these tools, the project ensures efficient deployment processes and automation.

Features:
Book Management: The API allows for the addition and management of books within the library system, including attributes such as title, author, genre, and availability status.

Author Management: Authors can be added and associated with books within the system, enabling better organization and categorization of library resources.

Reservation System: Users can make reservations for books through the API, managing the borrowing transactions seamlessly.

DevOps Integration
Dockerization: The project utilizes Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.

CI/CD Pipelines: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented using Jenkins, automating the build, test, and deployment processes for efficient development workflows.

Portainer Integration: Portainer is used for container management, providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing Docker containers.

Usage
The API can be accessed through HTTP endpoints, allowing users to interact with the library system programmatically. Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide developers on how to use the API effectively.

Conclusion
The Library-API project demonstrates the seamless integration of DevOps tools into the development and deployment processes, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency. By utilizing Docker containers, Jenkins, and Portainer, the project showcases best practices in modern software development and operations.
